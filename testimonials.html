  <p>Chosen Gospel Recovery AKA as The Ruby houses has done a lot for me and I will forever be grateful. When I first came to the Ruby’s house I was 19 years old scared a little girl running away from my thoughts and feelings shutdown to the world, wouldn’t open up to anyone and wouldn’t accept help.<br>
    I made a lot of mistakes, the biggest one was losing my daughter to DCFS and going to jail. That was my Rock bottom.<br>
    Yet Rev. Darlene Watley was the only one answering my phone calls and she came and picked me up with no hesitation and welcomed me back with open arms.<br>
    She helped me through the whole process of getting my daughter back.  Tami Poindexter also became my daughters Foster Parent While I was in the process of getting help.<br>
    I have never met anyone like Rev. Darlene Watley and Tami Poindexter, so dedicated and loving towards everyone in the Ruby houses.<br>
    They gave me everything I needed; love, support not only for me but for my daughter as well.<br>
    Everything happens for a reason, God put Rev. Darlene and Tami Poindexter in my life to help me become the better person that I am supposed to be.<br>

  <p>I met Rev Darlene in 2011 my life changed for the better when I moved into the Ruby house.<br>
    I was put in leadership (house leader)and from there I blossom into the God fearing woman Rev Darlene
    knew I could be. I learned sisterhood and how to be accountable.<br>
    I also learned to be of service . Although the first time was not easy it took me 3 times to truly get into Recovery forreal and be called on my stuff each time.<br>
    Rev Darlene welcomed me with open arms she is truly an Angel right here on earth. Rev Darlene (mommy) and Tam loved me until I could love myself they stayed on me until I got it right.<br>
    I also won my DCFS case because I used the
    tools they taught in self help meeting as guidance. I started Mental health services that were also offered and from there my journey began.<br>
    The Ruby house truly taught me life skills and to find God again, it's a great program,
    it will always have a special place in my heart, my son as well loved being there, very family oriented.<br>
    I have 3 years clean, I have been housed through section and I have a job and it's all because I chose Chosen Gospel Recovery to get my life back.<br>
    I will forever be grateful. </p>

  <p>When I think about me before the Ruby House, it almost seems so narrative. The person I am now, sometimes can barely believe that once upon a time that’s who I once was. That once a long time ago (not so long ago) that’s where I came from. But, indeed that’s where my recovery started. When I arrived at the Ruby House, I arrived damaged, broken, with nowhere to go, and completely alone left with no other options. I had lost my way, being guided only by life’s terms and my own stubbornness. You see it was my own stubbornness, and inability to make healthy decisions that led me into total destruction. <br>
    When I arrived at the Ruby House I didn’t understand how much I needed this place, and everything I would take from it.<br>
    At the Ruby House I finally had time to heal, from all the abuse I endured in the world. Some that were by my choice, but a lot that I had no control over.<br>
    At the Ruby house my journey towards stabilizing my mind, body and soul started. There I worked hard towards becoming a better person, even if at times it didn’t seem like I was making any progress at all. There I grew spiritually, my faith got tested so much that I thought I would break. But little did I know, back then that, that same faith would get me through trials and tribulations that I never thought I could live through. There I finally had a stable home, I finally was able to let my guard down enough to begin my journey to heal.<br>
    But the one thing that the Ruby House gave me that I really needed was a sense of family.<br>
    It has only been a few years since I left the Ruby House, I went from having no stability to making a peaceful home for me and my son.<br>
    I have been in therapy since the Ruby House, although  I still struggle at times with my mental health. I can now cope and find support thanks to the Ruby House.<br>
    Although I am still human and at times don’t make the best choices, I am working on it every day. Working on bettering myself, in every aspect and becoming a better version of the person I once was. It might not seem like a lot to many but the way I’m living now I would not change it, the kinda peace and love that comes from this is unexplainable. </p>

  <p>Sieda White aka Mommie’s arduous journey begin 10 years ago after traversing to LOS Angeles to care for her sick grandson who succumbed to his illness.<br>
    Unable to make phone calls for help to return home to GEORGIA she became the victim of elder abuse.<br>
    In February 2022  at the age of 100 years and 4 months she was blessed with two guardian angels Pastor Darlene and Tammie who not only rendered her the love, care, and kindness she hadn’t received for 10 years and literally saved her life.  They took her to the doctor, saw that she received her first covid vaccination, reunited her with her beloved companion tiger a chichuaua, gave her safe a happy home; contacted her adopted daughter 
    Cathy Loving who anxiously awaited her return to Riverdale GEORGIA on February 24, 2022, Her forever loving home. 
    All this was possible because of the tenacious work and generosity, of programs under the auspices directed by the phenomenal Pastor Darlene and for this we are truly grateful. </p>
